"""
Example demonstrating HYBRID mode with routing rules.

This script shows how to:
1. Define a simple OpenAPI specification with distinct endpoints.
2. Create an MCP plugin in 'hybrid' mode.
3. Configure routing rules within the `proxy_config` to direct:
    - Requests to one path to 'mock' mode.
    - Requests to another path to 'proxy' mode (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
4. Briefly discuss how `execute_test_plan` would interact with this.
