## [2.2.7] - 2025-06-02

### Fixed
- Version synchronization across project files
- Updated version consistency between pyproject.toml and __init__.py

### Changed
- Maintenance release with version alignment improvements

## [2.2.6] - 2025-06-01

### Added
- Comprehensive MCP Proxy functionality enabling mock, proxy, and hybrid modes for API testing.
  - Includes core proxy handling ([`ProxyHandler`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/proxy_handler.py:23)), configuration ([`ProxyConfig`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/config.py:128), [`AuthConfig`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/config.py:32), [`RouteRule`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/config.py:100)), authentication management ([`AuthHandler`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/auth_handler.py:25)), and plugin management ([`PluginManager`](src/mockloop_mcp/proxy/plugin_manager.py:15)).
  - Integrated proxy capabilities into MCP tools: [`create_mcp_plugin()`](src/mockloop_mcp/mcp_tools.py:997) and [`execute_test_plan()`](src/mockloop_mcp/mcp_tools.py:539).
- Detailed documentation guide for MCP Proxy: [`docs/mcp-proxy-guide.md`](docs/mcp-proxy-guide.md).
- New example scripts in [`examples/mcp-proxy/`](examples/mcp-proxy) demonstrating:
  - Plugin creation in `proxy` and `hybrid` modes: [`create_plugin_modes_example.py`](examples/mcp-proxy/create_plugin_modes_example.py).
  - Executing test plans with a `proxy` mode plugin: [`execute_plan_with_proxy_example.py`](examples/mcp-proxy/execute_plan_with_proxy_example.py).
  - Configuring `hybrid` mode with routing rules: [`hybrid_mode_routing_example.py`](examples/mcp-proxy/hybrid_mode_routing_example.py).
- New end-to-end integration tests for MCP Proxy in [`tests/integration/test_mcp_proxy_integration.py`](tests/integration/test_mcp_proxy_integration.py), covering `proxy` and `hybrid` mode configurations and execution.

### Changed
- Updated [`README.md`](README.md) to include a new section detailing the MCP Proxy functionality and linking to the guide.
- Refined existing example [`examples/mcp-proxy/basic-mock-example.py`](examples/mcp-proxy/basic-mock-example.py) to serve as the primary `mock` mode example and updated its "Next Steps" to reference new, more specific proxy examples.
- Modified [`examples/mcp-proxy/create_plugin_modes_example.py`](examples/mcp-proxy/create_plugin_modes_example.py) to focus solely on `proxy` and `hybrid` modes, deferring `mock` mode to `basic-mock-example.py`.
